Customer Behavior Analysis
📌 Project Overview
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses to optimize strategies, improve targeting, and increase revenue. This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior through data analytics, visualization, and machine learning. The analysis uncovers purchasing patterns, customer segments, and trends that drive decision-making.

🎯 Objectives
✅Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset.
✅Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and insights.
✅Apply segmentation techniques to group customers by behavior.
✅Build predictive models to forecast future purchasing patterns.
✅Visualize insights using clear and interactive charts.

⚙️ Features
✅ Data wrangling and handling missing values
✅ Statistical summaries and trend analysis
✅ Customer segmentation using clustering algorithms
✅ Predictive modeling for customer purchase behavior
✅ Rich visualizations for business decision-making
